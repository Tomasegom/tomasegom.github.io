Welcome to my first try on developing webAR without using commercial platforms to
maximize personalization and availability

This will be the base of what I'll do for the CETL in a while (as of Aug_6_2025) for the AR
experiences we want at the center

The website to enjoy the showcase is
    https://tomasegom.github.io/tomwebar.github.io

    - The target image can be found on the repository files
    - This showcase is just a test on HTML/CSS/MindAR capabilities and the freedom github pages provide

    - Site will ask you to allow access to the camera
    - It works on both mobile devices and laptop/pc with camera equipped
    - I'm using WebAR to enhance simplicity on the accessibility to the experience
    this avoids the necessity of downloading an app on the spot 
        - The making of an app is still in consideration if desired
